# Medical Diagnosis Assistant: Integrating Neural Networks and Language Models for Automated Analysis of X-Rays

## About

In the radiology world, radiologists must analyze an ever-increasing volume of X-ray images on a daily basis due to the exponential rise of medical imaging. This demanding pace not only poses challenges for accurate diagnosis but also strains the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Recognizing the pressing need for transformative solutions in this domain, we aim to automate  this process by creating a way to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze X-ray image input and generate a text radiology report, similar to ChatGPT. By applying this technology to the field of radiology, we seek to augment diagnostic accuracy while optimizing the operational workflow of this area of healthcare for the benefit of both radiologists and patients.
